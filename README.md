# Space Engineers Armor Block Replacer

A Python tool to automatically convert armor blocks in Space Engineers blueprints - light to heavy OR heavy to light!

## 🎯 Why Use This Tool?

**Save Hours of Tedious Manual Work!**

Converting armor types in Space Engineers is painful:
- ❌ Manually replacing hundreds or thousands of blocks takes **hours**
- ❌ Easy to miss blocks hidden inside your ship
- ❌ Risk of structural mistakes during manual conversion
- ❌ No way to batch convert multiple blueprints

**This tool does it all automatically in seconds:**
- ✅ Converts **entire blueprints instantly** (even 1000+ block ships)
- ✅ **100% accurate** - finds every armor block automatically
- ✅ **Bidirectional** - light to heavy OR heavy to light conversion
- ✅ **Completely safe** - creates new blueprints, never modifies originals
- ✅ **Zero game downtime** - works on blueprint files while you play
- ✅ **Batch processing** - convert your entire blueprint library at once

**Perfect for:**
- 🚀 Converting survival blueprints to combat-ready heavy armor
- 🏗️ Upgrading old designs without rebuilding from scratch
- ⚔️ Preparing fleet ships for PvP battles
- 💰 Downgrading expensive heavy armor ships to save resources
- 🔄 Testing designs with different armor types quickly

- Round armor variants
- 2x1 slopes and corners (base and tip)
- Half blocks and slopes
- Armor panels
- Sloped corners

### Small Grid
- All corresponding small grid variants of the above

For a complete list of mappings, run:
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py --list-mappings
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- **For Standalone GUI**: No external packages required (uses tkinter - included with Python)
- **For CLI**: No external packages required (uses Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system

```bash
# Verify Python version

## Usage

### 🖥️ Standalone Desktop App (Recommended)

#### Windows Launch

Double-click `launch_gui.bat` or run:

```bash
python gui_standalone.py
```

#### What You'll See

A native desktop application with tactical hologram styling:

- **Blueprint Database Panel** - Left side with search and scrollable list
- **Details Panel** - Right side showing selected blueprint information
- **Exchange Visualization** - Before/after block type display
- **Tactical Styling** - Gunmetal grey, neon cyan/orange, tech-glass effects

- ✅ **Threading** - Non-blocking UI during operations

### 💻 Command Line Interface

### Basic Usage

**Convert light to heavy armor (creates automatic backup):**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py path/to/blueprint/bp.sbc
```

**Convert heavy to light armor:**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py path/to/blueprint/bp.sbc --reverse
```

### Advanced Options

**Save to a different file:**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py input.sbc -o output.sbc
```

**Process without creating backup:**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py blueprint.sbc --no-backup
```

**Enable verbose output:**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py blueprint.sbc -v
```

**List all armor block mappings:**
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py --list-mappings
```

### Command-Line Arguments

```
usage: se_armor_replacer.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] [--no-backup] [--reverse] [--list-mappings] [input]

positional arguments:
  input                 Path to blueprint file (bp.sbc) or directory containing it

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file path (default: modify in place)
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  --no-backup           Do not create backup file when modifying in place
  --reverse             Convert heavy armor to light (instead of light to heavy)
  --list-mappings       List all armor block mappings and exit
```
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output
  --no-backup          Do not create backup file when modifying in place
  --list-mappings      List all armor block mappings and exit
```

## Finding Blueprint Files

Space Engineers blueprints are typically located at:

**Windows:**
```
%APPDATA%\SpaceEngineers\Blueprints\local\<YourBlueprintName>\bp.sbc
```

**Steam Workshop:**
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\244850\<WorkshopID>\bp.sbc
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Process a local blueprint
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Blueprints\local\MyShip\bp.sbc"
```

### Example 2: Batch process with custom output
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py input_ship.sbc -o heavy_armor_ship.sbc -v
```

### Example 3: Process directory (automatically finds bp.sbc)
```bash
python se_armor_replacer.py "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Blueprints\local\MyShip"
```

## How It Works

1. **Scan**: The tool parses the Space Engineers blueprint XML file
2. **Identify**: Searches for all `<CubeBlock>` elements with light armor `SubtypeId` values
3. **Replace**: Swaps light armor SubtypeIds with their heavy armor equivalents
4. **Save**: Writes the modified XML back to the file (or new location)
5. **Backup**: Automatically creates a `.sbc.backup` file (unless disabled)

## XML Structure

Space Engineers blueprints use XML format with structure like:
```xml
<Definitions>
  <ShipBlueprints>
    <ShipBlueprint>
      <CubeBlocks>
        <MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlock>
          <SubtypeId>LargeBlockArmorBlock</SubtypeId>
          <!-- This gets replaced with LargeHeavyBlockArmorBlock -->
        </MyObjectBuilder_CubeBlock>
      </CubeBlocks>
    </ShipBlueprint>
  </ShipBlueprints>
</Definitions>
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Could not find bp.sbc"**
- Ensure you're pointing to the correct blueprint directory
- The file must be named exactly `bp.sbc`

**Error: "Failed to parse XML file"**
- The blueprint file may be corrupted
- Ensure Space Engineers isn't currently running or modifying the file

**No replacements made**
- Your blueprint may already use heavy armor blocks
- Use `--list-mappings` to see what blocks can be replaced
- Use `-v` for verbose output to see scanning details

## Safety

- **Automatic Backups**: The tool creates backups by default (`.sbc.backup` files)
- **Read Original First**: Always keep a copy of your original blueprint
- **Test in Creative**: Test converted blueprints in creative mode first
- **Non-Destructive**: Original files are preserved unless `--no-backup` is used

## Limitations

- Only processes blueprint files (`bp.sbc`), not world saves
- Does not modify paint colors or skin settings
- Does not adjust component costs (handled by Space Engineers)
- Requires manual reload in Space Engineers to see changes
