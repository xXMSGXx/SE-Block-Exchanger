## GUI Highlights

- CustomTkinter modular UI (`ui/` package)
- Category toggles for conversion mapping selection
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+O` open, `Ctrl+R` run, `Ctrl+Z` undo
- Recent blueprint directories and quick access
- Native Windows drag-and-drop loading
- Before/after diff preview
- Analytics dashboard: PCU/mass counters, category distribution, ore -> ingot -> component -> block tree, conversion deltas, health audit with fix actions
- CSV/TXT analytics export
- Profile editor: create/edit/duplicate, add/remove pairs with subtype suggestions, test against blueprint, import/export `.sebx-profile`, import from URL, Discord share payload
- In-app changelog and update notifications

---

## Mapping Registry

Built-in categories:

- `armor` (70 pairs)
- `thrusters`
- `weapons`
- `functional`
- `dlc_substitution` (vanillafies blueprints by replacing premium DLC blocks with base-game equivalents)

Profiles auto-load from `profiles/` at startup. Bundled mod profiles:

- `profiles/weaponcore.sebx-profile`
- `profiles/assertive_armaments.sebx-profile`
- `profiles/build_vision.sebx-profile`

---

## SE2 Transition Utilities

Prepare creations for **Space Engineers 2** (VRage 3 Engine):

- **SE2 Readiness Score** — audits scripts, mechanical chains (pistons/rotors/hinges), and DLC footprint, producing a readiness score.
- **DLC -> Base Convert (Vanillafyer)** — replaces DLC blocks with vanilla alternatives so blueprints load for everyone.
- **Grid Rescaler (Large <-> Small Grid)** — scales block types and coordinates between grid sizes.

---

## Security

- XML parsed via `defusedxml` to prevent XXE and entity-expansion attacks.
- Release pipeline pins all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs and publishes SHA-256 checksums alongside every binary.
- Dependabot keeps Actions and Python dependencies updated.

Report security issues privately to Meraby Labs (do not open a public issue).

---

## Packaging and Release (internal)

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Release workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (triggered by tag `vX.Y.Z`)
- Version source of truth: `version.py`
