"""
Safe XML parsing helper.

Wraps defusedxml.ElementTree.parse when available to harden against XXE,
billion-laughs, and external-DTD attacks. Falls back to xml.etree.ElementTree
when defusedxml is not installed (e.g. minimal CLI installs without
requirements.txt). Only the parse path is hardened — Element construction and
serialization continue to use the standard library.
